About

This application was based off of @hereismari project which utilizes Flask to connect to Spotify's Web API. The changes that I made were the addition of a recommendation tab that uses the profile's top tracks, artists, and genres to recommend tracks. Additionally, application layout changes were made. This project is still under development and if there are any ideas for new additions please let me know!

How to Use

In order to run this application, the conf.json file must be edited so that it contains the ID and Secret which matches your Spotify Application. After changing that, run app.py to start the server. The web address will bring you to a login page that you will need to sign into your Spotify account.
